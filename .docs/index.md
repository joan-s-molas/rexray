# REX-Ray

Openly serious about storage

---
The long-term goal of the REX-Ray project is to enable collaboration between
organizations focused on creating enterprise-grade storage plugins for the
Container Storage Interface (CSI). As a rapidly changing specification, CSI
support within REX-Ray will be planned when CSI reaches version 1.0, currently
projected for a late 2018 release. In the interim, there remains active
engagement with the project to support the community.

REX-Ray is an open source, storage management solution designed to support
container runtimes such as Docker and Mesos. REX-Ray enables stateful
applications, such as databases, to persist and maintain its data after the life
cycle of the container has ended. Built-in high availability enables
orchestrators such as [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/),
[Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), and [Mesos
Frameworks](http://mesos.apache.org/) like
[Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) to automatically orchestrate
storage tasks between hosts in a cluster.

Built on top of the [libStorage](./user-guide/servers/libstorage.md)
framework, REX-Ray's simplified architecture consists of a single binary and
runs as a stateless service on every host using a configuration file to
orchestrate multiple storage platforms.

## Getting Started
The following command will install the latest version of REX-Ray to
`/usr/bin/rexray` on Linux systems:

```sh
$ curl -sSL https://rexray.io/install | sh
```

Depending on the Linux distribution REX-Ray will be registered as
either a SystemD or SystemV service.

### Configure
REX-Ray requires a configuration file for storing details used to communicate
with storage providers. This can include authentication credentials and driver-
specific configuration options.

After REX-Ray has been installed, copy and paste the contents from the
[REX-Ray Configuration Generator](http://rexrayconfig.codedellemc.com/) to a
new file on the host at `/etc/rexray/config.yml`. The configuration generator
will satisfy the majority of use cases for REX-Ray.

For more advanced and manual options, such as using multiple storage platforms,
and sample configurations of all supported storage platforms, refer to the
libStorage Storage Providers
[documentation](./user-guide/storage-providers.md).
Additionally, look at [core properties](./user-guide/config.md#configuration-properties)
and [logging](./user-guide/config.md#logging).

#### Example
Here is a simple example for using Oracle VirtualBox:

```yaml
libstorage:
  service: virtualbox
virtualbox:
  volumePath: $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes
```

Refer to the VirtualBox
[documentation](./user-guide/storage-providers.md#virtualbox)
for additional configuration options.

Start the VirtualBox SOAP API service using:

```sh
$ vboxwebsrv -H 0.0.0.0 -v
```

From here, REX-Ray can now be used as a command line tool. View the commands
available:

```sh
$ rexray --help
```

To verify the configuration file is working, use REX-Ray to list the volumes:

```sh
$ rexray volume ls
ID                                    Name             Status    Size
1b819454-a280-4cff-aff5-141f4e8fd154  libStorage.vmdk  attached  16
```

If there is an error, use the `-l debug` flag and consult [debugging
instructions](/#getting-help).

### Start as a Service
Container platforms rely on REX-Ray to be running as a service to function
properly. For instance, Docker communicates to the REX-Ray Volume Driver via a
UNIX socket file.

```sh
$ rexray service start
```

### Demo
View the [Vagrant Demo](./user-guide/demo/) as well as visit the [{code}
Labs](https://github.com/codedellemc/labs) for more information on ways to
setup REX-Ray and run different types of applications such as Postgres and
Minecraft.

## Getting Help
Having issues? No worries, let's figure it out together.

### Debug
The `-l debug` flag can be appended to any command in order to get verbose
output. The following command will list all of the volumes visible to REX-Ray
with debug logging enabled:

```sh
$ rexray volume ls -l debug
```

For an example of the full output from the above command, please refer to this
[Gist](https://gist.github.com/akutz/df2afe2dc43f75b67b8977f398095ed7).
