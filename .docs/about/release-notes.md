## Version 0.11.4 (2019/01/15)
This is a minor release that includes support for AWS NVMe storage.

### Enhancements
* Support AWS NVMe storage
  ([\#1252](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1252), [\#1104](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1104))

## Version 0.11.3 (2018/06/12)
This is a minor release that improves support for Ceph, Cinder, and Digital
Ocean. It also disables the Docker CSI bridge that was previously enabled by
default in 0.11.0. Users experienced problems with the bridge when large volume
counts were present.

CSI has deprecated support for it's 0.1 release and REX-Ray has removed initial
support for CSI with this release. CSI support within REX-Ray will be planned
when CSI reaches version 1.0, currently projected for a late 2018 release.

### Enhancements
* Enable `DOCKER_LEGACY` mode by default
  ([\#1226](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1226))
* Add support in Cinder driver for custom CA certificate and insecure mode
  ([\#952](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/952))

### Bug Fixes
* Fix volume filtering by region in Digital Ocean
  ([\#1164](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1164))
* Fix support for Ceph Mimic in RBD driver by properly parsing new output
  format ([\#1231](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1231))

## Version 0.11.2 (2018/02/24)
This is a minor release that updates the build process to reflect the
new location of binary artifacts.

## Version 0.11.1 (2017/12/19)
This is a minor release that addresses a few bugs.

### Enhancements

* Upgrade AWS GoSDK to v1.12.46
  ([\#1128](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1128))
* Add support for automatic volume paging on Digital Ocean when large number of
  volumes are present ([\#1131](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1131))
* Support setting of `EBS_ENDPOINT` in EBS Docker Managed plugin
  ([\#1132](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1132))
* Use CentOS as base OS for `csi-nfs` Docker managed plugin and add example
  documentation ([\#1114](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1114))

### Bug Fixes
* Fix issue in Ceph RBD driver that improperly parsed the contents of the
  cephArgs config value. ([\#1098](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1098))
* Correct the machine hardware name for s390x
  ([\#1111](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1111))
* Correct the RPM package so that installed package can be removed and upgraded
  without issue. ([\#1088](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1088))
* Fix issue that made disabling path caching have no effect
  ([\#1110](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/pull/1110))
* Fix issue that could prevent volume attach/detach operations on Micorsoft
  Azure from working properly ([\#1122](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1122))
* Fix issue where setting `EBS_ENDPOINT` had no effect
  ([\#1118](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1118))

## Version 0.11.0 (2017/10/16)
This is a major release that introduces the Docker Volume API to CSI
southbound adapter -- a bridge that enables the consumption of CSI plug-ins
by Docker. This new Docker to CSI bridge is enabled by default when running
REX-Ray as a service, while the
[Docker Managed Plugins](https://hub.docker.com/r/rexray/) default to
the existing Docker Volume API endpoint.

### New Features
* Introduce a new Docker Volume API to CSI bridge that allows Docker to consume
  CSI plugins. ([\#1037](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1037))

  ([\#1075](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1075),
  [\#1077](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1077))
* Upgrade Ceph client in RBD managed plugin to Luminous release
  ([\#1050](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1050))
* Enable `S3FS_ENDPOINT` in s3fs managed plugin
  ([\#1042](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1042))
* Expand managed plugin configuration options
  ([\#1056](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1056))
* Allow custom Ceph cluster name and non-admin user
  ([\#1035](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1035))

### Bug Fixes
* Fix issue in CSI-libStorage bridge that would prevent idempotent creates after
  a restart. ([\#1060](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/1060))
* Fix volume pre-emption in Cinder driver. This bug prevented Cinder from working
  in Docker Swarm mode ([\#913](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/913))

Each week he designs a new, daily-dose of word related pain for the truly cross-fit. And still Harshavardhana was able to come up with a four-letter acronym that describes a different kind of way to use a bucket -- "S3FS". Thank you Harshavardhana! |

## Version 0.10.0 (2017/09/11)
Hi, REX here. Look, I know it's been a while since the last release. Three
whole months. I'm not going to apologize either. I'm an anthropomorphic dog

[Sébastien GLON](https://github.com/sebglon) | Lord GLON is heir to the Dukes of Brittany and currently resides Château des Ducs de Bretagne along the Loire River. One can only imagine the vistas to which Lord GLON is privilege as he gazes out the arrow-loops carved into the stone exterior of his office wall. When not creating pull requests for REX-Ray Lord GLON is rumored to be carrying on a torrid affair with Mayor Rolland, the first female, and certainly most stunning, to hold the office in Nantes. We submit the most humble of gratitudes to Johanna for the pittance of time she allowed Lord GLON to separate from her and attend to the Cinder plug-in. Many thanks to you both.

[Mathieu Velten](https://github.com/MatMaul) | Mr. Velten, as his people alert you to the fact that he insists on being addressed, is a dubious individual. It's apparent he's old money, but it's also not exactly clear from where his fortune originated. There are rumors in the back rooms of the shadiest gambling parlors of Monte Carlo that Mr. Velten was once an employee of an unnamed wing of a shadow government. A "cleaner" if you will. Maybe it was these experiences that make Mr. Velten so apt at slicing up Git commits. Is there really any difference between slicing up a full-grown man and hash series of changes? Mr. Velten is proof there isn't.
[Joe Topjian](https://github.com/jtopjian) | Joe insisted that we omit this pithy attempt at showing gratitude, but we simply could not do that. Not when Mr. Velten insisted it would be in our best interest to include Joe. Is this okay Mr. Velten? Can our families come home now? We did what you asked. Joe is awesome. We like Joe. See? We're cooperating. Please Mr. Velten, just let them come home!

[Chris Duchesne](https://github.com/cduchesne) | Chris is my partner in crime when it comes to libStorage and REX-Ray. Without him I would have absolutely no one to take the fall for the heist I'm planning. So is Chris invaluable? Yeah, in that way, as the patsy who will do at least a dime while I'm on the beach sipping my drink, yeah, he's invaluable.
[Travis Rhoden](https://github.com/codenrhoden) | Travis, or as I call him, T-Dawg, is essential to "taking care of business." He comes to work to chew bubblegum and kick butt, and he leaves the gum at home!
[Vladimir Vivien](https://github.com/vladimirvivien) | A little known fact about Vladimir is that he's been seeded in the top 10 of the last US Opens, but has had to withdrawal at the last minute before each of those tournaments due to other responsibilities. What those are? Who can say? Are they contracts on people's lives? Perhaps. Are they appearances for Make a Wish? Probably. The only thing we know for sure is that when he is seen again, Vladimir seems rejuvenated and ready to conquer the tennis world yet again.
[Steve Wong](https://github.com/cantbewong) | I've known Steve for a very long time, and in that time I can say I've never once seen him in the same room as President Barack Obama. Now, does that mean that I can definitively state that Steve and President Obama are in fact the same person. No, of course not. There are obvious differences. The most glaring of course being that Steve wears glasses and President Obama does not. However, other than that the two men are nearly identical. I guess we'll never know if Steve Wong lives a double life as the 44th President of these United States, but I personally would like to think that yeah, he does.
[Dan Norris](https://github.com/protochron) | Dan "The Man" Norris is well known in the underground street-swimming circuit. Last year he tied Michael Phelps in the Santa Monica Sewer 120 meter medley. He would have won if not for stopping to create the DigitalOcean driver for libStorage.
[Alexey Morlang](https://github.com/alexey-mr) | As a third-chair oboe player in the Moscow orchestra it is surprising that Alexey still finds time to contribute to the project, but coming from a long line of oboligarchs (oboe playing oligarchs), it's just in his nature. As is creating storage drivers. That, and, well, playing the oboe.
[Andrey Pavlov](https://github.com/Andrey-mp) | There is no Andrey. You have not met him. He does not exist. Don't look behind you. He is not there. He is writing storage drivers. Then just like that, he's vanished.
[Lax Kota](https://github.com/Lax77) | Lax is a rock star in the Slack channel, helping others by answering their questions before the project's developers can take a stab. We do not want to upset him. It's rumored he beats those who upset him in order to provide inspiration for his true passion -- corporal poetry. Every punch thrown is another verse towards his masterpiece.
[Jack Huang](https://github.com/jack-fittedcloud) | Jack is not his job. Jack is not the amount of money he has in the bank. Jack is not the car he drives. Jack is not the clothes he wears. Jack is a supernova, accelerating at the speed of light beyond the bounds of quantifiable space and time. Jack is not the stuff above. Jack is not the stuff below. Jack is not the stuff in between. Jack is not the empty void. Jack. just. is.


## Version 0.7.0 (2017/01/23)

## Version 0.4.0 (2016/06/20)
REX-Ray 0.4.0 introduces centralized configuration and control along with
a new client/server architecture -- features made possible by
[libStorage](http://libstorage.readthedocs.io). Users are no longer
required to configure storage drivers or store privileged information on all
systems running the REX-Ray client. The new client delegates storage-platform
related operations to a remote, libStorage-compatible server such as REX-Ray
or [Poly](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/polly).

Please note that the initial release of REX-Ray 0.4 includes support for only
the following storage platforms:

* ScaleIO
* VirtualBox

Support for the full compliment of drivers present in earlier versions of
REX-Ray will be reintroduced over the course of several, incremental updates,
beginning with 0.4.1.

### New Features
* Distributed architecture ([#399](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/399), [#401](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/401), [#411](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/411), [#417](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/417), [#418](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/418), [#419](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/419), [#420](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/420), [#423](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/423))
* Volume locking mechanism ([#171](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/171))
* Volume creation with initial data ([#169](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/169))

### Enhancements
* Improved storage driver logging ([#396](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/396))
* Docker mount path ([#403](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/403))

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed issue with install script ([#409](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/409))
* Fixed volume ls filter ([#400](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/400))
* Fixed panic during access attempt of offline REX-Ray daemon ([#148](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/148))

binaries.

## Version 0.3.0 (2015-12-08)

### New Features
* Pre-Emption support ([#190](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/190))
* Support for VMAX ([#197](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/197))

* Support for Google Compute Engine (GCE) ([#194](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/194))

### Enhancements
* Added driver example configurations ([#201](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/201))
* New configuration file format ([#188](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/188))

### Tweaks
* Chopped flags `--rexrayLogLevel` becomes `logLevel` ([#196](https://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray/issues/196))

### Pre-Emption Support
Pre-Emption is an important feature when using persistent volumes and container
schedulers.  Without pre-emption, the default behavior of the storage drivers is
to deny the attaching operation if the volume is already mounted elsewhere.  
If it is desired that a host should be able to pre-empt from other hosts, then
this feature can be used to enable any host to pre-empt from another.

## Version 0.2.0 (2015-09-30)

### Installation, SysV, SystemD Support
REX-Ray now includes built-in support for installing itself as a service on
Linux distributions that support either SystemV or SystemD initialization
systems. This feature has been tested successfully on both CentOS 7 Minimal
(SystemD) and Ubuntu 14.04 Server (SystemV) distributions.

To install REX-Ray on a supported Linux distribution, all that is required
now is to download the binary and execute:

    sudo ./rexray service install

What does that do? In short the above command will determine if the Linux
distribution uses systemctl, update-rc.d, or chkconfig to manage system
services. After that the following steps occur:

 1. The path /opt/rexray is created and chowned to root:root with permissions
 set to 0755.
 2. The binary is copied to /opt/rexray/rexray and chowned to root:root with
 permissions set to 4755. This is important, because this means that any
 non-privileged user can execute the rexray binary as root without requiring
 sudo privileges. For more information on this feature, please read about the
 [Linux kernel's super-user ID (SUID) bit](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Security-HOWTO/file-security.html).

 Because the REX-Ray binary can now be executed with root privileges by
 non-root users, the binary can be used by non-root users to easily attach
 and mount external storage.

 3. The directory /etc/rexray is created and chowned to root:root.

The next steps depends on the type of Linux distribution. However, it's
important to know that the new version of the REX-Ray binary now supports
managing its own PID (at `/var/run/rexray.pid`) when run as a service as well
as supports the standard SysV control commands such as `start`, `stop`,
`status`, and `restart`.

For SysV Linux distributions that use `chkconfig` or `update-rc.d`, a symlink
of the REX-Ray binary is created in `/etc/init.d` and then either
`chkconfig rexray on` or `update-rc.d rexray defaults` is executed.

Modern Linux distributions have moved to SystemD for controlling services.
If the `systemctl` command is detected when installing REX-Ray then a unit
file is written to `/etc/systemd/system/rexray.servic`e with the following
contents:

    [Unit]
    Description=rexray
    Before=docker.service

    [Service]
    EnvironmentFile=/etc/rexray/rexray.env
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rexray start -f
    ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
    KillMode=process

    [Install]
    WantedBy=docker.service

The REX-Ray service is not started immediately upon installation. The install
command completes by informing the users that they should visit the
[REX-Ray website](http://github.com/joan-s-molas/rexray) for information on how to
configure REX-Ray's storage drivers. The text to the users also explains how
to start the REX-Ray service once it's configured using the service command
particular to the Linux distribution.

### Single Service
This release also removes the need for REX-Ray to be configured as multiple
service instances in order to provide multiple end-points to such consumers
such as `Docker`. REX-Ray's backend now supports an internal, modular design
which enables it to host multiple module instances of any module, such as the
DockerVolumeDriverModule. In fact, one of the default, included modules is...

### Admin Module & HTTP JSON API
The AdminModule enables an HTTP JSON API for managing REX-Ray's module system
as well as provides a UI to view the currently running modules. Simply start
the REX-Ray server and then visit the URL http://localhost:7979 in your favorite
browser to see what's loaded. Or you can access either of the currently
supported REST URLs:

    http://localhost:7979/r/module/types

and

    http://localhost:7979/r/module/instances

Actually, those aren't the *only* two URLs, but the others are for internal
users as of this point. However, the source *is* open, so... :)

If you want to know what modules are available by using the CLI, after starting
the REX-Ray service simply type:

    [0]akutz@poppy:rexray$ rexray service module types
    [
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "DockerVolumeDriverModule",
        "addresses": [
          "unix:///run/docker/plugins/rexray.sock",
          "tcp://:7980"
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "AdminModule",
        "addresses": [
          "tcp://:7979"
        ]
      }
    ]
    [0]akutz@poppy:rexray$

To get a list of the *running* modules you would type:

    [0]akutz@poppy:rexray$ rexray service module instance get
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "typeId": 1,
        "name": "AdminModule",
        "address": "tcp://:7979",
        "description": "The REX-Ray admin module",
        "started": true
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "typeId": 2,
        "name": "DockerVolumeDriverModule",
        "address": "unix:///run/docker/plugins/rexray.sock",

Hmmm, you know, the REX-Ray CLI looks a little different in the above examples,
doesn't it? About that...

### Command Line Interface
The CLI has also been enhanced to present a more simplified view up front to
users. The commands are now categorized into logical groups:

    [0]akutz@pax:~$ rexray
    REX-Ray:
      A guest-based storage introspection tool that enables local
      visibility and management from cloud and storage platforms.

    Usage:
      rexray [flags]
      rexray [command]

    Available Commands:
      volume      The volume manager
      snapshot    The snapshot manager
      device      The device manager
      adapter     The adapter manager
      service     The service controller
      version     Print the version
      help        Help about any command

    Global Flags:
      -c, --config="/Users/akutz/.rexray/config.yaml": The REX-Ray configuration file
      -?, --help[=false]: Help for rexray
      -h, --host="tcp://:7979": The REX-Ray service address
      -l, --logLevel="info": The log level (panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug)
      -v, --verbose[=false]: Print verbose help information

    Use "rexray [command] --help" for more information about a command.

### Travis-CI Support
REX-Ray now supports Travis-CI builds either from the primary REX-Ray repository
or via a fork. All builds should be executed through the Makefile, which is a
Travis-CI default. For the Travis-CI settings please be sure to set the
environment variable `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` to `1`.
